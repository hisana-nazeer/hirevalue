---

Value+Ed helps job seekers understand the strengths, weaknesses, and real-world value of their résumé. Instead of guessing what to improve, users receive instant, AI-driven insights so they can upskill with purpose and accelerate their career growth.

---

## 🚩 Problem
Most job seekers revise their résumés without knowing what actually matters to employers. They don’t know which skills are missing, which sections need strengthening, or how competitive their profile truly is.  
Traditional résumé reviews are slow, subjective, and often expensive.

**Value+Ed solves this by giving fast, consistent, actionable insights powered by AI.**

---

## ✨ How It Works
1. User uploads a PDF résumé.  
2. PDF.js extracts the text client-side.  
3. The extracted text is sent to an AI model.  
4. The model evaluates skills, clarity, formatting, seniority signals, and relevance.  
5. The app displays:  
   - Predicted **Hire Value**  
   - Key strengths  
   - Improvement suggestions  
   - Skill gaps and next-step guidance  

Everything runs smoothly in the browser with a modern UI.
